The issue was resolved by carefully reviewing each of the affected classes in the HTML.  It turned out there were some subtle typos in the class names, particularly in the responsive modifier classes.  After correcting the typos, all the classes were applied correctly. This highlights the importance of double-checking class names when using Tailwind CSS, especially when using multiple modifiers. In addition, I verified that all the necessary Tailwind directives were present in the `tailwind.config.js` file to ensure the customizability of the CSS was working.  The corrected code is provided in `bugSolution.html`.
