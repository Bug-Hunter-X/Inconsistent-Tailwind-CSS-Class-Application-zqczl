# Inconsistent Tailwind CSS Class Application

This repository demonstrates a bug where Tailwind CSS classes are not consistently applied, specifically those involving complex responsive design modifiers.

## Bug Description
Tailwind CSS classes are not applied to certain elements.  The HTML structure is valid, and the Tailwind CSS configuration appears correct.  The issue only affects specific classes, not all of them.

## Steps to Reproduce
1. Clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` in a web browser.
3. Observe that some Tailwind CSS classes are not applied as expected, particularly complex responsive modifier classes.

## Solution
The solution involves carefully reviewing the class names and responsive design modifiers for accuracy. There might be subtle errors or conflicts.  We need to check for any syntax errors in the classes or potential naming conflicts.  If the issue continues, ensure the Tailwind configuration is correct and that the necessary CSS files are included.
