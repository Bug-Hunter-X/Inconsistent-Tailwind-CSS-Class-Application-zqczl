I encountered an issue where Tailwind CSS classes weren't being applied correctly to my components.  The CSS was included properly, but some classes, particularly those involving complex responsive design modifiers, seemed to be ignored.  My HTML structure was valid and followed Tailwind's conventions.  I checked for typos, but everything looked correct. The issue only affected certain classes and not others.
